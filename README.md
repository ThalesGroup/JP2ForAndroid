# JP2 for Android
---------------------------
An open-source JPEG-2000 image encoder/decoder for Android based on [OpenJPEG](http://www.openjpeg.org/) v2.4.0.

## Set up
Add dependency to your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
implementation 'com.gemalto.jp2:jp2-android:1.0.3'
```

## Basic Usage
Decoding an image:
```java
Bitmap bmp = new JP2Decoder(jp2data).decode();
imgView.setImageBitmap(bmp);
```
Encoding an image:
```java
Bitmap bmp = ...;
//lossless encode
byte[] jp2data = new JP2Encoder(bmp).encode();
//lossy encode (target PSNR = 50dB)
byte[] jp2data = new JP2Encoder(bmp)
                     .setVisualQuality(50)
                     .encode();
```

## Advanced Usage
### Multiple Resolutions
A single JPEG-2000 image can contain multiple resolutions.
The final resolution is always equal to `<image_width> x <image_height>`; each
additional resolution reduces the width and height by the factor of two. If you 
don't need the full resolution, you can save memory and decoding time by
decoding at a lower resolution.

#### Encoding
Default number of resolutions is 6, but you can specify your own value:
```java
byte[] jp2data = new JP2Encoder(bmp)
                     .setNumResolutions(3)
                     .encode();
```
The number of resolutions must be between 1 and 32 and both image width and height
must be greater or equal to `2^(numResolutions - 1)`.

#### Decoding
You can obtain the number of resolutions (as well as some other information 
about the image) by calling the `readHeader()` method:
```java
Header header = new JP2Decoder(jp2data).readHeader();
int numResolutions = header.numResolutions;
```
If you don't need the full resolution image, you can skip one or more
resolutions during the decoding process.
```java
Bitmap reducedBmp = new JP2Decoder(jp2data)
                            .setSkipResolutions(2)
                            .decode();
```



### Multiple Quality Layers
Multiple layers can be encoded in a JPEG-2000 image, each having a different
visual quality. If you don't need maximum visual quality, you can save 
decoding time by skipping the higher-quality layers.


#### Encoding
Quality layers can be specified in two ways: as a list of compression ratios 
or visual qualities. The **compression ratios** are specified as factors of compression, 
i.e. 20 means the size will be 20 times less than the raw uncompressed size. 
Compression ratio 1 means lossless compression. Example:
```java
byte[] jp2data = new JP2Encoder(bmp)
                     //specify 3 quality layers with compression ratios 1:50, 1:20, and lossless.
                     .setCompressionRatio(50, 10, 1)
                     .encode();
```

**Visual quality** is specified as [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) 
values in dB. Usable values are roughly between 20 (very
aggressive compression) and 70 (almost lossless). Special value 0 indicates
lossless compression. Example:
```java
byte[] jp2data = new JP2Encoder(bmp)
                     //specify 3 quality layers with PSNR 30dB, 50dB, and lossless.
                     .setVisualQuality(30, 50, 0)
                     .encode();
```

`setCompressionRatio()` and `setVisualQuality()` can not be used at the same time.


#### Decoding
You can obtain the number of available quality layers by calling 
the `readHeader()` method:
```java
Header header = new JP2Decoder(jp2data).readHeader();
int numQualityLayers = header.numQualityLayers;
```

If you don't need a maximum quality image, you can trade some visual quality 
for a shorter decoding time by not decoding all the quality layers.
```java
Bitmap lowQualityBmp = new JP2Decoder(jp2data)
                              .setLayersToDecode(2)
                              .decode();
```

### Source Decode Region
Sets the region of the source image that should be decoded. The region will be clipped to the 
dimensions of the source image. Setting this value to null will result in the entire image
 being decoded.

#### Decoding
You can obtain the width/height of image by calling
the `readHeader()` method:
```java
Header header = new JP2Decoder(jp2data).readHeader();
int imgWidth = header.width;
int imgHeight = header.height;
```

If you don't want to decode the entire image, you can set the source region to be decode.
```java
Bitmap partOfBmp = new JP2Decoder(jp2data)
                              .setSourceRegion(Rect(0,0,imgWidth/2,imgHeight/2))
                              .decode();
```


### File Format
`JP2Encoder` supports two output formats:
* JP2 - standard JPEG-2000 file format (encapsulating a JPEG-2000 codestream)
* J2K - unencapsulated JPEG-2000 codestream

JP2 is the default output format, but it can be changed:
```java
byte[] j2kdata = new JP2Encoder(bmp)
                     .setOutputFormat(FORMAT_J2K)
                     .encode();
```
